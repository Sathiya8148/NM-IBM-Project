📊 Working

The SPA loads a single HTML file.

JavaScript dynamically manipulates the DOM to update content.

Routing is handled client-side using the browser’s history API.

Data is fetched asynchronously from APIs without reloading the page.

Would you like me to tailor this README for a specific framework (like React, Angular, or Vue)? I can rewrite it accordingly.
